## About Me:

I'm a passionate roboticist and software engineer who takes a systems approach to robotics to create platforms that can perform efficiently, effectively, and robustly in real world conditions. In my doctoral research at the GRASP Laboratory (University of Pennsylvania) I studied underactuated, modular, reconfigurable, aquatic systems for ocean research and monitoring, and in my professional career I write software for real-time control and path-planning for mobile robots and manipulators.

My main project at the University of Pennsylvania is the [**Modboats**](www.modlabupenn.org/modboats) at the GRASP Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, which are underactuated robots that are capable of modular self-reconfiguration. They run on a stack of:
* Embedded code: ESP32 processor programmed in *Arduino*
* Offboard planning code: *Python* software stack handling motion capture and planning for the robot. (Replaces a *Matlab* software stack)

Most of my work is *hidden* in private organizational repositories. If you want to see samples, shoot me a message or an email and I'm happy to share it.
* I do extensive C++ development of real-time, often multi-threaded systems
* I work extensively in ROS2
