## About Me:

I'm a passionate roboticist and software engineer who takes a systems approach to robotics to create platforms that can perform efficiently, effectively, and robustly in real world conditions.
- In my doctoral research at the GRASP Laboratory (University of Pennsylvania) I studied underactuated, modular, reconfigurable, aquatic systems for ocean research and monitoring.
- In my professional career I write software for real-time control and path-planning for mobile robots and manipulators.

My main project at the GRASP Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania was the [**Modboat**](www.modlabupenn.org/modboats), underactuated single-motor robots that are capable of modular self-reconfiguration and energy-efficient ocean monitoring. Modboats run on a stack of:
* Embedded code: ESP32 processor programmed in `C++` <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/cplusplus/cplusplus-original.svg" title="C++" alt="C++" width="20" height="20"/>
* Offboard planning code: `Python` <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" title="Python" alt="Python" width="20" height="20"/> software stack handling motion capture and planning for the robot. 

Most of my work is *hidden* in private organizational repositories. If you want to see samples, shoot me a message or an email and I'm happy to share what I can.
* I do C++ development of real-time, often multi-threaded systems with an emphasis on efficiency and speed. 
* I work extensively in ROS2, Linux, and Docker.
